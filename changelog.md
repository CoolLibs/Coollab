# Changelog

##

- ✨ Coollab now works on MacOS!
- 🤏 Added shortcuts <kbd>CTRL</kbd><kbd>+</kbd> and <kbd>CTRL</kbd><kbd>-</kbd> to zoom the UI
- 🤏 Renamed "UI Scale" as "UI Zoom"
- 🤏 Improved fullscreen mode (<kbd>F11</kbd>). The window will no longer minify when clicking on another screen. It is also faster to switch between fullscreen and non-fullscreen, and the window does not flicker weirdly when switching to another window or screen.
- 🐛 We now stop checking for webcams info as soon as we stop using a webcam
- 🐛 When exporting an image that overwrites an existing image file, the backup project that we create will now also overwrite the existing backup project. And we added a warning to tell you that this will happen and ask for your confirmation.
- 🟦 Nodes: renamed "2D Variation (Gradient)" as "Make Displacement Map"
- 🟦 Nodes: renamed "Displace" as "Displacement Map" + improved it and added some parameters
- 🟦 Nodes: added "Distance", that gives the distance to a Shape (green nodes)
- 🟦 Nodes: better default values for "Fisheye" parameters

## 1.0.0 Launcher

### Launcher

- ✨ We are now using a launcher that will auto-install new Coollab versions automatically
- 💥 You can no longer open a project directly from Coollab, you have to go through the Launcher. (This is to ensure we use the right version of Coollab for each project, instead of facing an "incompatible version" error when trying to open it)
- ✨ Added a field to rename the project, in the center of the top menu bar
- ✨ Reworked how "Save As" works, to be more intuitive. You also have an option in the Settings menu to change its behaviour.

### Quality of Life changes

- ✨ Added shortcut <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd> to quickly export an image
- ✨ The aspect ratio of the View is now controlled through a small button in the View
![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a536802b-9e06-40f7-bd57-7485d5a37859)
- 🤏 Merged Camera and Inspector windows. You can now edit camera values in the Inspector, when no node is selected.
![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7536282-3431-4f0b-97e7-dc3da13c8ca2)
- ✨ Removed some useless options in the Node's Inspector. Renaming a node is now done by right-clicking on it (or pressing <kbd>F2</kbd>)
![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/520b1999-61b5-4a49-9b08-33a23ecfac75)
- ✨ Added a progress bar for long operations like exporting an image, and it will no longer freeze Coollab while the operation is in progress
![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/421febbc-5c94-471e-93bf-0d7388f7f278)

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73f3b250-8f33-4c9c-b602-63d5496027b5)

### New and improved nodes

- 🟦 Added a Glow node that works on any Image (the previous one only worked on Shapes, and is still here because it still looks better on Shapes than the new one). Thank you to [illtellyoulater](https://github.com/CoolLibs/Lab/issues/110) for this contribution!
![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3337367d-d2ee-498b-a5ff-ba2131ecbedb)
- 🟦 Added "Monochrome" node
![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08d7d280-c8b9-4ae2-b640-20d6c4817a9a)
- 🟦 Added "MIDI Multi-Select with Transition" node
![](https://github.com/CoolLibs/Lab/assets/45451201/bb809bdf-c0ae-44c1-af53-2ef3961d99fa)
- 🟦 "Mirror Repeat" and "Grid" nodes now have a "Content Size" parameter to allow you to fit your content in the square that will be repeated
![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af5f70ee-d43c-488c-bc03-bc691d072386)
- 🟦 Image, Video, Webcam and Color Ramp are now using the "Mirror" repeat mode by default. This can be changed in the Inspector.
![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/117959ea-2b25-4fff-ba76-db739f3f090f)
- 🟦 Changed feedback loop node, you can now apply effects after the feedback node, that won't affect the image sent back into the loop (NB: this is still an experiment, this node will be greatly improved in the future)

### Miscellaneous

- 🤏 Webcams now open faster
- 🤏 Better error messages when the webcam doesn't work, and it is faster to re-open once the problem is fixed
- 🚧 You can now send http requests to Coollab to set values (NB: this is still a work in progress, we will document it later once it is stabilized)

### Bug fixes

- 🐛 Improved the linearity of our gradients from black to white
Before: (notice the huge black region on the left)
![Before](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f6ef0e9-a67f-438a-8226-11d6b9e52330)

- 🐛 Fixed a bug that caused the Nodes window to zoom out a bit each time you opened Coollab.

## 🐣 Beta 11

- ✨ Added particles! This a very promising prototype that you can already use today. An important overhaul of the system will come at some point in a (probably distant) future. (NB: Unfortunately particles are not currently available on MacOS, and will not be for a very long while).
